# DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION


In previous [Project 6(https://github.com/rxneyo/Darey.io-PBL/blob/main/project6.md)) I implemented a WordPress based solution that is ready to be filled with content and can be used as a full fledged website or blog. Moving further we will add some more value to our solutions that your DevOps team could utilize. We want to introduce a set of DevOps tools that will help our team in day to day activities in managing, developing, testing, deploying and monitoring different projects.


The tools we want our team to be able to use are well known and widely used by multiple DevOps teams, so we will introduce a single DevOps Tooling Solution that will consist of:


1. `Jenkins` – free and open source automation server used to build CI/CD pipelines.

2. `Kubernetes` – an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.

3. `Jfrog Artifactory` – Universal Repository Manager supporting all major packaging formats, build tools and CI servers. Artifactory.

4. `Rancher` – an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage Docker and Kubernetes in production.

5. `Grafana` – a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application.

6. `Prometheus` – An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.

7. `Kibana` – Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.



##   Setup and technologies used in Project 7


As a member of a DevOps team, one will implement a tooling website solution which makes access to DevOps tools within the corporate infrastructure easily accessible.

In this project I had to implement a solution that consists of following components:

1. **Infrastructure:** AWS
 
2. **Webserver Linux:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8


3. **Database Server:** Ubuntu 20.04 + MySQL

4. **Storage Server:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server

5. **Programming Language:** PHP

6. **Code Repository:** GitHub
