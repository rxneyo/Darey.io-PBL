# Load Balancing With Apache


In Project-7 we had 3 Web Servers and each of them had its own public IP address and public DNS name. A client has to access them by using different URLs, which is not a nice user experience to remember addresses/names of even 3 server, let alone millions of Google servers.

In order to hide all this complexity and to have a single point of access with a single public IP address/name, a **Load Balancer** can be used. A Load Balancer (LB) distributes clientsâ€™ requests among underlying Web Servers and makes sure that the load is distributed in an optimal way.
